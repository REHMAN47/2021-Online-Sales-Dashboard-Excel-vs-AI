## ⚠️ Real-Time Issues & Limitations

###  Excel (Manual Approach)
- ❗ Manually created calculated fields: `FinalPrice`, `TotalRevenue`, `IsReturned`
- ⚠️ Tedious slicer linking between multiple PivotTables
- 📉 Layout control required attention across multiple sheets
- 💾 File performance slowed with large datasets or complex visuals

###  Quadratic (AI Approach)
- ❌ Limited options to customize chart types (e.g., stacked, combo)
- 🔒 Advanced formulas (`SUMIFS`, conditional logic) are restricted
- ⚠️ Some AI-generated insights were too general or needed manual validation
- 📸 Dashboard had to be captured manually as image (no native export)
