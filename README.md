## ⚠️ Real-Time Issues & Limitations

###  Excel (Manual Approach)
- ❗ Manually created calculated fields: `FinalPrice`, `TotalRevenue`, `IsReturned`
- ⚠️ Tedious slicer linking between multiple PivotTables
- 📉 Layout control required attention across multiple sheets
- 💾 File performance slowed with large datasets or complex visuals

###  Quadratic (AI Approach)
- ❌ Limited options to customize chart types (e.g., stacked, combo)
- 🔒 Advanced formulas (`SUMIFS`, conditional logic) are restricted
- ⚠️ Some AI-generated insights were too general or needed manual validation
- 📸 Dashboard had to be captured manually as image (no native export)

## My Experience with This project 

This project gave me hands-on experience comparing AI-powered tools with traditional manual methods — and I gained a lot of practical insight:

- ⚖️ While Excel provides precise control, it demands more manual setup — Quadratic removes that overhead by automating much of the logic.
- 🧠 Excel forces you to think through every calculation, which is great for learning — while Quadratic lets you focus more on the big picture.
- ⚡ Quadratic is ideal when time is tight and insights are needed fast — but Excel shines when data accuracy and complex customization matter.
- 🔍 With Excel, you build everything from the ground up — in Quadratic, AI does the heavy lifting so you can validate and adjust quickly.
- 🎯 Excel taught me how to engineer dashboards manually, while Quadratic showed me how fast AI can generate usable results with minimal input.
- 💡 Both tools served different purposes: Excel gave me mastery over structure, Quadratic gave me momentum to ideate rapidly.
- 🧩 Excel requires you to connect all the pieces — Quadratic offers pre-built insights, which is great for starting fast or for non-analysts.

Each approach had its strengths — and together, they helped me think more flexibly about how to approach future data projects depending on timeline, audience, and tool availability.
